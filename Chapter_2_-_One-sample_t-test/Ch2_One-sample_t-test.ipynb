    "\n",
    "The data analysed here were produced and analysed originally by Mehr, S. A., Song. L. A., & Spelke, E. S. (2016). For 5-month-old infants, melodies are social. Psychological Science, 27, 486-501. The data analysed below were downloaded from https://sites.google.com/view/openstatslab/home and stored in the same Github repository where these notebooks are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "The research focused on the seemingly universal act of parents singing to their children and that this singing appears to focus their childs attention towards the parent that is singing. Mehr et al. (2016), aim was to study the function of this singing between mother and child. in particular Mehr et al. hypothesised that these specific melodies convey social information to infants.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resarchers argued that social groups share melodies and that different melodies exist between social groups. These shared melodies might signal to infants that novel individuals who sing these songs are from the same social group. Therefore, if a novel person sings a familiar melody this may signal to the infant group membership of this novel individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "All together, 32 parent and infant pairs were recuited with the aim of testing the hypothesis that melodies signal group membership to infants. The methodology they used to test this hypothesis involved taking each infant and mother pair in and  teaching them a new lullaby during theit first visit to the lab. The parents were then asked to sing the new lullaby to the infant every day for a 1-2 weeks before the return to the lab for the experimental session. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Experimental session consisted of showing the infants side by side videos of two unfamilliar individuals, on seperate screens. As with many infant studies the infant gaze is the standard behavioural measure for assessing infants attention. During the initial period of the experiment the two unfamiliar faces were presented with them both smiling at the infant silently. This allowed expert raters to produce baseline gaze proportions. This was followed by the each of the unique indivduals singing their lullaby (either the one the mother had been taught or one that had the sme rhythm, and lyrics but the melody was different). Folwwing this singing of the luublabies the infants were then left to view the two individuals when silent and smiling, to record another gaze proportion score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of particular concern for this notebook is the Baseline proprtion scores, which were analysed in the orignal study using a one sample t-test with its goal to test if there was any bias in the infants basline gaze proportions as a group by comparing  the $\\bar{x}$ with a hypothsied proportion of $\\mu = .5$, to test for any statistical differnce. Mehr et al. did noto find a statistically significant differecne at the $\\alpha \\leq .05$ and proceeded to claim that this showed tere was no bias in baseline proprotion for either of the indivudals presented on the two screens. There are statistical reasoning faults of this approach due to the limits of the NHST that will not be discussed further here. However, for the interested parties Dienes (2014) explains the problem nicely and how Bayesian methods can offer a solution, and it will not be discussed further here, because the methods below offer a Bayesian estimation solution to the problem of determining any bias is baseline gaze probabilistically in the fashion of a Bayesian estiamtion equivalent of the one sample t-test."

    "The posterior predictive check shows that the simulated data sets condtioning the model on the data vary from  the original data sets. This could mean many things; the first being that an alternative better fitting model may need to be fit or   secondly that the small amount of data from a highly variable measure of infant gaze which has to go through a noisy expert rater) is presenting a simple reality that our model and its resulting inferences are more uncertain. Of course, this is not neccesarily a problem it just needs to be communicated to and appreciated by the audience that is viewing the results of the analysis, whom may even recommend improvements for the model and the modellers choices."

    "<font size = \"3\">As Kruscke correctly points out there is not standard formula or presentation method for results like the APA guide for reporting frequentist analyses using the Bayesian framework. It is likely there never will be, because as McElreath (2020) explains, Bayesian data analysis is more like a engineering approach to the problem and the resulting model that is fit will be analysis specific. In addition, as Gabry et al, (2019) have argued visualisations maybe even more key, so all the visualtions above would have to be included with any write up. Anyway, the write up below generally follows the advice of Kruscke (2015) chapter 25. In any application though it comes down to the problem to be described and the audience that needs to be convinced. </p><br/>\n",
